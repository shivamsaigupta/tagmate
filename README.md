Tagmate is a fully-deployed production-level cross-platform app built using React-Native and serverless architecture. The app, which is live on Google Play Store and Apple App Store, allows you to discover new events and host your own events in your university.

The app features include 

 - Swipable newsfeed

 - Push Notifications (for both iOS and Android devices)
 - User profiles
 - Google Authentication integration
 - Group messaging
 - Direct messaging
 - and more...
