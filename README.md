A fully-deployed production-level cross-platform app built using React-Native and serverless architecture. Tagmate is an app that allows you to discover new events near you and host your own events.

Tagmate is built using React-Native on the front-end and Firebase's Cloud Functions for maximum scalability. The app features include swipable newsfeed, integration with Google Calendar, Push Notifications (for both iOS and Android devices), user profiles, Google Authentication integration, group text messaging and direct messaging.

Discover whats happening near you. Swipe left to decline, swipe right to signal your interest in attending the event. When you swipe right, the event is added to your dashboard, where you can access all of your upcoming and past events.
